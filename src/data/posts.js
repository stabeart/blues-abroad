PSG are due a shitter. 

The Parisians have a combined scoreline of 16-1 across the six games they’ve played in this year’s Club World Cup. That one goal conceded? During the second matchday, when Botafogo, in what might go down as a turning point in world football, overturned the European Champions 1-0. And to the credit of Botafogo, Luis Enrique fielded a fierce starting lineup and eventually used all five substitutions available to him. While the loss was by no means resounding, it did show that PSG are capable of being picked apart and denied, even by firm underdogs.

While Chelsea are not such firm underdogs, it’s hard to deny that PSG are the best team in the world at the moment—my only wish is that we had seen them play Barcelona in the Champions League final. They’ve been a joy to watch in the latter half of this season; they’re a dynamic, fluid, yet clinical and ruthless force who have trampled practically every European giant (and non-giant) stood in their way. In possession, Enrique’s made great use of two fast, intelligent, attacking wing-backs—both unsung heroes of PSG’s success—overlapping an interchangeable front three of surgical, incisive wingers and inside forwards. It’s hard to pick one star, and that’s been the root of their success this season. In a classic case of what I call “The Ronaldo Effect,” removing the most talked about man in football from the team has allowed them to actually focus on their game, and they don’t look like letting up anytime soon.

But Chelsea are Chelsea, and you best believe that Luis Enrique knows that. We’ve been underdogs in most international finals, and ran out winners in many of them. For the first time since Tuchel, the Chelsea of the past few months and weeks has looked a cohesive, confident, capable team. Out of nowhere, and with basically no changes, Maresca turned what was a shockingly uninspiring defensive line into a solid, reliable unit: Levi Colwill has matured leaps and bounds in this last season, showing not just better decision making but a confidence and leadership which harkens back to Chelsea centre backs of old; Tosin Adarabioyo, the elder statesman (at 27), has been a solid second choice for the best part of last season; in the Fluminense semifinal, Trevoh Chalobah looked his old, composed self, keeping the ball as far away from Robert Sanchez as possible. And what needs to be said about Marc Cucurella, Chelsea’s knight in shining armor? If not the best left-back in the world, Cucu is second only to his Iberian counterpart at PSG, Nuno Mendes. And last but not least, a purportedly fit Reece James, who’s looking to start on Sunday, has the unique ability to decide big matches—we can only hope the Captain stars in the final. 

Offensively, Chelsea continue to look promising. Cole Palmer’s on form, Pedro Neto’s up for player of the tournament, and the new boys are getting it done. Even Christopher Nkunku was balling out against Fluminense. Nicholas Jackson—who I’ll touch on in another post—still seems to be our weakest attacking link. With Joao Pedro and Liam Delap available, I should hope Maresca doesn’t choose the final as Jackson’s last-chance saloon, although I’m increasingly worried he will. Maresca has shown a ruthlessness, though, in his recent treatment of Jackson, which leaves me hoping that Delap or Pedro will get the nod. Behind the attack, Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez have been mint. Fernandez plays the more attacking role, scoring once and assisting thrice this tournament, while Caicedo has carved out his status as one of the world’s best holding midfielders. Watching him in the semi, I had to hold back the tears remembering N’golo Kante’s contribution to our Champions League winning run. For Chelsea fans of a certain age, who grew up wishing they could have seen Super Frank and N’Golinho in the double pivot, Caicedo and Fernandez arouse some strange sense of dream-nostalgia. Off the bench, Andrey Santos looks the real deal, and little needs to be said about Romeo Lavia’s ability (when fit!). 

Our biggest weakness, and the man most likely to lose us this final, is Robert Sanchez. While the 27 year old goalkeeper has looked more assured between the sticks this tournament, little needs to be said about his poor performance in one-on-ones and generally cringeworthy decision making. In a Chelsea career spanning two seasons and repeated calls for his dismissal, Robert Sanchez has succeeded only in widening the gap between Chelsea supporters and the club’s management. His status at Chelsea confounds me; either the coaching staff or the board see something in Sanchez that no one else does, and maybe his semi-reliable performance in this competition is enough to justify keeping him. For myself, and, I suspect, the majority of fans, Robert Sanchez induces sheer panic whenever he gets near the ball. Against the most shrewd, clinical team in the world, Sanchez has nowhere to hide. While I hope to god he rises to the occasion, a loss in this final might guarantee his exit. What do I know, though, except this: EghBoehly works in mysterious ways. 

For his part, Enzo Maresca has also shown a degree of flexibility throughout this competition, rotating positions and adapting his system for who he has available. Above all, Maresca has to be credited for getting us to this final. It might be the optimist in me choosing to believe Maresca threw the match against Flamengo, but whether that’s true or not, he’s steered us through the knock-outs comfortably. And now, his team has reached its biggest test thus far. Financially, the $40 million difference between winning and losing is notable, but shouldn’t change anything major for Chelsea’s summer strategy and future planning. This final means far more for the players, who kicked on this season and, in the past few months, began to look like a well-tuned, cohesive unit. Win or lose—and I hope its win—this infamously young team has gained a lot from this tournament, and a good showing in this final will undoubtedly boost our confidence going into next season. The first big final is a milestone for every great Chelsea team (just as the Conference League final was a milestone for our B-team). These are the games we’re meant to play in, and there’s no doubt in my mind this is the first of many for this new Chelsea side. PSG are due a shitter. Come on Chels.

    content: `Okay, okay, I get it, believe me: there are too many idiots sharing opinions about football. The internet was a beautiful concept. Sadly, for all the good it’s done, the World Wide Web has also enabled every dickhead who did five keepy-uppies in year nine to spew sacreligious bile from the atomized comfort of their two bedroom flat. Enter your dear author, born and raised in the dark isolation of YouTube videos and social media. A sort of Bane figure, if you will. I digress. There are too many idiots sharing opinions about football. Each day, I come to this conclusion in some way or another: as I scroll minute-long clips of professional actors hocking milktoast opinions on players they never watched, or when I see said former players grifting for Keir Starmer’s austere Labor or the World Economic Forum. In fairness, I don’t expect much from mainstream media, and less so when it comes to football. The press is always bought, especially in Europe; you need only have observed the generational media support for Gareth Southgate’s knighthood bid to realize this. The worst offenders in the football media shitscape are the once-journos-turned-PR-machines, fastidiously reporting on Lamine Yamal’s wet dreams while private consortiums buy up every mid-level team in Europe. The outlook for regular fans like me is bleak, and each day I find myself seeking a place to gather my thoughts and put them out into the world, however insignificant they might be. I love this sport, and I love talking about it, so I’ve created this site/blog/fan forum as a place for me to talk about football. You might hate what I have to say. You might not. In all likelihood, you probably won’t even read it. I don’t really care. If you’re interested, stick around.

While I won’t be focusing solely on Chelsea, I’ve themed this site around them because, well, they are my club, and for whatever reason I enjoy discussing them. Most of the things I post here will have to do with Chelsea, although I’ll throw in some general observations and think (stink) pieces. I’ll be updating and restructuring this website as I see fit; it’s a living passion project.
