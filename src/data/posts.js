    title: "MARESCA SACKED",
    date: "January 1, 2026",
    content: `The most painful aspect of this sacking is the knowledge that the peak of this club's success has already passed. Until this ownership leaves---which, barring a US invasion of Greenland, won't be happening anytime soon---Chelsea will continue on a path of never-ending regression towards mediocrity. 

Maresca had many flaws as a manager, chief among them his inability to actually manage a match as it was happening. The first nineteen games of this season have been some of the worst since this ownership took over. But he was not sacked because of the results---at least, not for his part in the results. He was sacked because he wanted to amend these bad results by improving the squad. Maresca has left for the same reasons every other half-decent manager has left in the past few years, in that it seems impossible for anyone to operate at a high level under this ownership. Between the cynical transfer policy and the board's despotic oversight, any worthwhile manager  would do well to stay far away from this club. 

Let's not also pretend that Maresca didn't see this coming, and that he hasn't been angling for a departure should things not go his way. I think we all saw something like this coming after his post-Everton press conference in December; the more scrupulous of us understood his signing with agent Jorge Mendes as the salvo of his departure. When Maresca was announced as manager at the start of last season most fans decried him as a yes-man brought in to do the board's bidding, to steady the team on the pitch while they did their dirty financial work in the background. If he turned out to be too opinionated and ambitious, coming from a Championship Leicester City side, then who else could possibly make this job work? 

It should be clear to everyone by now that this ownership, and the charlatans they've brought in run the club, have an at best incidental interest in succeeding on the pitch. And yet what they purport to be good at---the flipping of players, the financial trickery, the incessant branding---doesn't seem to work very well either. None of the players at the club now will be here in two seasons, regardless of how well they play, and the meager profit we make will only fund the next cycle of mediocre youngsters. We still don't have a front-of-shirt sponsor, despite the endless stream of clothing collaborations and social media campaigns. Simply put, this is not a football club in anything other than name and image. Until these owners leave, we could have as many promising young managers as we'd like; the best has already come and gone, and, at that, in the form of a Conference League and a Club World Cup. It's unfortunate that these trophies will mark Maresca's legacy at Chelsea. He did a good job with what he was given, and all signs pointed upwards, at least on his end. Given the time and the resources, he would have undoubtedly gone on to achieve bigger things at the club. I'm sure he will wherever he lands next.

    title: "MANCHESTER UNITED PREVIEW",
    date: "September 19, 2025",
    content: `
Much has been made, over the past few days, of the fact that Chelsea haven't won at Old Trafford since the 2012/13 season. This stat plagues the subconscious of Chelsea fans. Despite the fact that, in recent years, Chelsea have clearly surpassed Man United from a footballing perspective, we perennially fail to overcome the spirit of the reds at home. And despite looking like the favorites going into the match, I can't ignore the niggling feeling that Manchester will show up in full force on Saturday. 

History, though, needn't bear on the future. The stat-line, for all it says about the past, has been desperately waiting to be broken. This Chelsea team have gotten off to a haphazard start, in part due to the demands of the summer, but also due to the sheer number of new faces at the club. For all their inexperience, we have a new host of young, driven, determined players who would relish the opportunity to ball-out against the most historied club in the country. Chief among them, and the player I'm most hoping will start the match, is United reject Alejandro Garnacho. In his few cameos in blue so far, Garnacho looks like a snug fit for Maresca's system. Against Brentford, he came on for a frustrated Pedro Neto and instantly injected pace into our attack, eventually setting-up Caicedo's second goal of the season. Even against Bayern, Garnacho looked something of a threat, albeit one stifled by Chelsea's goal deficit. This is a player who, many have seem to forgotten, spearheaded United's attack for two seasons, picking up quite a few remarkable goals as well as the 2024 Puskás Award. After a tumultuous past 12 months in Manchester, one can only hope Garnacho is rearing to prove himself against the club, and the manager, which shut him out. We've seen his determination and game-changing ability many a time in red and, for all the drama of his personal life, Garnacho undeniably possesses the intangible combination of arrogance, confidence, and shit-housery fans have come to expect from the fixture. All this, coupled with Pedro Neto's underwhelming recent performances on the left wing, demand that Garnacho get his first proper start for Chelsea. 

Opposite Garnacho, I hope to see a refreshed Estêvão bombing down the right wing. Between the two, completing the triumvirate, there's one clear candidate -- I'll give you a hint; it's not Enzo Fernandez. Coming off back-to-back goals in two games, it only has to be Cole Palmer, the same man who famously shocked a traveling United in the 2023/24 season. If Garnacho and Estêvão can't rise to the occasion, we all know Palmer will; I can already see him in the 30th minute, barreling through United's scrappy midfield in transition, and slotting the ball past whichever sacrificial lamb Amorim gives the nod to between the sticks, or else laying it off to João Pedro up front. Behind these four, controversially, I hope to see Andrey Santos given the start alongside Caicedo. Enzo Maresca has shown a reticence to start the long-awaited new arrival so far, instead opting for a dreadfully inconsistent Fernandez or an out-of-position Reece James. Santos has shown he has the skill, and the ceiling, to meaningfully contribute towards Chelsea's midfield. This match would be the perfect opportunity to see what he can do, against a midfield two fashioned from pumice, in a game which matters so desperately to the fans. 

The back line is where things get a little dicey. We've clearly underprepared defensively for the season ahead, although, in fairness to the club, we have at least five center-backs on the wage bill. While Tosin will surely not face the same exposure he did against Bayern, his performances so far have left much to be desired. At the risk of fielding too many relative unknowns, I do think this is a good opportunity to see Wesley Fofana return at center-back alongside Trevoh Chalobah. Maresca has clealy been managing Fofana's fitness, but we really do need to start seeing him perform in the position we bought him for. None of this third-choice right back nonsense; give him the chance to properly prove himself. On the right side of defense, then, it's only right that Reece James gets the nod. These are the matches he performs best in; need I remind you of his beautiful turn-and-assist for Marc Cucurella last time around. Opposite James there's only one man for the job in Cucurella. I do think there's a decent chance we see Jorrel Hato start on the let, but, quite like James, Cucu possesses that intangible drive which can win these sorts of games. Rounding out the team, it only has to be Robert Sanchez -- arguably our player of the season so far -- in goal. 

I've come to terms with the fact that I'll never understand Maresca's starting lineups. Despite the beautiful team sheet I've just laid-out, the manager will undoubtedly have a surprise for us come Saturday. Maybe we'll see Buonanotte start on one of the wings, or someone shoe-horned into the midfield or front line. There's a depressing chance that Tyrique George starts up front in place of Pedro, who Maresca has admitted wasn't feeling "100 percent" for the past two games. If the manager understands the stakes of this game though, and what it means to both our fans and our season, he will get it right. A win against United, while unspectacular compared to recent years, will do wonders for our confidence. We have no excuse not to do it.

I'm predicting a 3-2 win for Chelsea. We have the talent up front to catch United out, but we have also, in fairness, shown a leakiness in defense. That, along with the potential bragging rights for both teams, will open this game up massively. It will be something of a nail-biter, although Chelsea's quality and relative compactness should see us through the game. I do think these are an important three points for our season, and while United are now a midtable side, they still possess the individual quality and will to take a game to anyone. The outcome will rest entirely on Maresca's starting lineup, and whether he can finally show some confidence in his players. That being said, I'm not putting any money on this one.

What an excruciating watch. Pathetic.

The first half was some of the most uninspired football I've seen Chelsea play since April. For the minor joy Enzo Maresca has brought us, today's match once again exposed his inadaptability. The manager's insistence on a controlled build-up out of defense repeatedly shows its flaws against humbler sides who are willing to sit in a low block, turn the ball over, and hoof it up-field to a solitary striker. In many cases, Chelsea's opponent needn't even take the route one approach; Fulham's disallowed goal came from the same scenario, where Muniz knocked the ball past a stranded Caicedo and controversially found King on the break. 

Today's first goal was even less excusable in my eyes, particularly when Chelsea's build-up was so drab. Every viewer of football knew exactly what was happening as Henderson knocked the ball up to Schade, and any already dubious Tosin watchers winced as he tried to recover. Tosin's game in general was sloppy today; his clearances were half-hearted, his touches heavy, and his passes ill-conceived. Unfortunately, Maresca identified the problem exactly when he said we have no ball-playing alternative to Levi Colwill. Trevoh Chalobah, to his credit, looked solid on the ball, however Chelsea's build-up from defense sorely lacks a confident, consistent passer. Tosin proved today that he's not that. What's more, his performances of late leave doubts as to his individual defensive ability, especially in one-on-ones. As soon as Schade slowed down on the ball, my stomach began turning, having seen it all already. I found some sick gratification, felt myself an oracle, struck with the vision of Tosin twisting and turning like Odysseus against the winds just to watch it play out before me. In identical fashion to Josh King's goal, Tosin stood off, let the attacker compose himself and cut in, and threw out a leg at the vital moment. He got away with it once in the early stages of the match, and even then one felt fate shining kindly on him. Were his build-up better, maybe he'd get away with the odd mistake -- the same courtesy has been extended to Levi Colwill. Today though, as in the last match, Tosin showed he's not the stalwart Chelsea needs. He also owes me a Xanax script.

There were good individual performances today, though. Caicedo yet again showed why he's our best player, putting in a man-of-the-match worthy performance before dragging Chelsea briefly in front. He was everywhere during the match, and didn't place a foot wrong; I'd go so far as to say he placed every foot right. It's been a good week for holding midfielders, and I'm sure Caicedo felt the urge to remind everyone who he is. His partner -- who increasingly finds himself drifting up front -- in Enzo Fernandez also put in a long-overdue shift. His recovery play impressed most, although the Argentine did spearhead some decent chances. The unsung hero of this match must be Robert Sanchez. He can't be blamed for the first goal, and was marooned by our defense for the second. Taking the knee like it's prime 2020, Sanchez martialed our back line  well and certainly saved us a point in the table. He looks to be growing into the number-one role and, despite past criticism, has put in a consistent shift over the past months. I find myself no longer worrying every game about our keeper, and that counts for a lot in my mind.

It was also good to see Cole Palmer back on the scoresheet. Like many, I didn't expect to see him feature today, and I wondered whether he looked to be slightly limping as he entered the pitch. Despite the injury concern, Palmer made an instant impact which left me wondering how the game might've turned out had he started. We're still yet to see the Cole Palmer-Joao Pedro link-up in full -- hopefully Maresca's saving it for Wednesday night against Bayern. Pedro, for his part, had a fairly quiet game, although he was doing the work of both a striker and a number 10. As the more experienced -- along with Pedro Neto -- of our starting front four, Pedro tried to cover both the half-spaces and the forward position. He wasn't helped by the duo of Facundo Buonanotte and Jamie Bynoe-Gittens, the latter of whom clearly needs far more experience at this level. Buonanotte had a decent debut, although he lacks the flair and creativity of a Palmer or Pedro. Filling-in at attacking midfield -- which might well be where Maresca envisions him -- Buonanotte linked-up fairly well, though lacked the incision required of the position. His performance bore a similarity to many Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall jobs of yesteryear; filling-in, progressing the play, but lacking the mythical final ball which ultimately wins matches.

Not much can be said about Brentford's second goal. I hate to see long throws becoming fashionable again, although it seems they're insistent and demand respect from managers. We knew it was coming, and we simply shut-off; it didn't help that Garnacho, on his debut, was left at the back post marking the man who ultimately scored. 

My final remarks are this: Chelsea should have won that game, and would have had we played it later in the season. Whether by managerial over-caution or genuine fitness issues, we had to rely on many of our new youngsters -- who, it must be said, came at a great financial cost. These players have the quality, but need more than a few weeks to adapt to and (hopefully) thrive under the strictness of Maresca's system. It's always better to draw than to lose, especially away, however Chelsea fans should rightly come away from the match disappointed and expecting more, particularly going into such a daunting run of matches.

Fulham were unlucky for many reasons today, but perhaps most unlucky that this game didn’t take place a mile down the road. After a dominant first twenty minutes, Fulham pulled ahead incisively, with 18-year-old Joshua King leaving Tosin for broke, twisting past the 27-year-old center back, and then sending Rob Sanchez the wrong way with a right foot strike into the bottom left corner. The goal was well-deserved, well-taken, and well-in-line with the run of play up to that point. After a review which felt like eternity, the goal was ruled out by Rob Jones for a supposed “careless challenge” by Rodrigo Muniz in the build-up. 

Fans and players alike have already called out the decision, with some calling it “the worst in EPL history.” This is no doubt an overstatement, and I think Chelsea fans could argue it was the right call. It’s one of an increasing number of Premier League decisions that, nine times out of ten, would go the other way. Looking at the incident, it’s clear that Muniz controlled the ball long before Chalobah made any sort of challenge, and unwittingly planted his other foot on Chalobah’s—who, it has to be said, never had a chance of getting the ball. Simply put, it’s the kind of call that, had this match been held in any other stadium, wouldn’t have required an on-field review. Had this match taken place even ten years ago, I sincerely doubt we’d run out winners. The rules of the game—or, the way they’re applied—seem to be mutating in real time. This deserves its own piece, but the events of the first half leading up to Joao Pedro’s 54th-minute goal show yet again how VAR slows the game down and complicates, rather than streamlines, the referee’s job. Today, it became clear why Chelsea couldn’t spare the budget to bid on Xavi Simons; all that money went into funding Rob Jones’ new foyer. 

Chelsea looked tired and stultified in the first half, especially in the minutes leading up to King’s disallowed goal. Enzo Fernandez stuck out once again for his poor first touch, sloppy passing, and truancy in defense. It’s unclear whether Fernandez has been instructed to push into the front line, or just naturally finds himself there, but his defensive reticence in the first half nullified Chelsea’s ability to recover. Multiple times, most notably in the disallowed goal, Chelsea gave up possession just behind our absurdly high press, leaving three defenders and a marooned Moises Caicedo to scramble in recovery. While Caicedo put in another impressive performance, it’s unreasonable of either Maresca or Fernandez (or both) to expect him to control a Premier League midfield by himself. Were it not for Joao Pedro’s man-of-the-match performance across the pitch, Chelsea’s defensive exposure would have most certainly cost us more in this game.

Now, Joao Pedro needs talking about. What a player. I don’t think anyone, apart from the player himself and maybe the Chelsea management, expected this level from Pedro to start his Chelsea career. While his headed goal was crucial, and a breath of fresh air for Chelsea fans, the more impressive aspect of Pedro’s game today was his defensive grit. In a performance which put Enzo Fernandez to shame, Pedro constantly tracked back, made the vital challenge, and catalyzed the few promising attacking moves we made. Most outstanding was his goal-line clearance off a corner which kept Fulham squarely out of the game. He’s on the sort of form we’ve come to expect from Cole Palmer, and can only hope will continue throughout the season. I do think, after his last few games, we’ll see a lot more of Joao Pedro as an attacking midfielder behind the striker, as he’s shown a clear ability to spearhead our attack in that position. This, however, illuminates the silent problem at Chelsea: we need another striker.

Even with Delap and Palmer in the team, there’s not a clear choice in the central forward position. As I’ve said, Joao Pedro demands starting off the striker. Liam Delap, for all his physical and ball-striking ability, is not yet the undeniable goal threat which Chelsea need, and some of his best performances so far have been in starting alongside Pedro. With Nicholas Jackson headed to Bayern Munich—a move which Chelsea are now desperately trying to cancel—it’s clear that we need more depth in the position. I do not want to see Tyrique George, or more likely Bynoe-Gittens, Neto, or new-kid-on-the-block Garnacho, filling in at striker when Delap and Palmer inevitably get injured again. Maybe this was acceptable under Pochettino, but it simply can’t run in a Chelsea team this energetic, youthful, and ambitious. We need a credible goal scorer who can challenge, or start alongside, Pedro and Delap. I wouldn’t be upset if this were another hybrid player like Joao Pedro, or even an unnatural striker like Nico Jackson. In regards to the latter, and I never thought I’d say this, I hope he stays. Ironically, while it looks like Jackson has fallen out of favor with the Chelsea decision-makers, the second/third-choice role at Chelsea FC is a perfect fit for him. It’s the same job he’d be doing at Bayern, and I think he’d find himself much more warmly-received by the fans without the pressure of being first on the team sheet. I even think being forced to compete for minutes would bring something to Jackson’s game we haven’t yet seen at Chelsea. And to be fair, most of us were saying this last season; he’s not bad, he’s just not consistent enough to start week-in week-out. 

I think Chelsea’s past two league results have been a poor representation of where we are. Even more so than against Crystal Palace, we deserved a draw today. Without Palmer or an out-and-out striker, we look limp in attack. It’s no coincidence that, of the seven goals we’ve scored so far this season, four have come off corners, with a fifth coming from Fernandez’s penalty today. This is the sort of sweaty bollocks we mocked Arsenal for last season, and while it’s good to know we can scrape results off VAR and set-pieces, we simply must show more open-play attacking threat. Hopefully we can come back from the international break well-rested and with more offensive vim.

Ultimately, the game goes down as a success for Chelsea, and the kind of result required of a Premier League team at the highest level. In fairness, we’ve been long-overdue a controversial referee performance in our favor. Maybe I’m already spoilt, though, but this is not the way I want to see Chelsea winning games, and certainly not this early in the season. For the sake of our season, I hope we come off the break with something of a new attacking approach, or at least some variety.

There are many places you could begin after a game like that. I’ll start with one of my favorite moments: amidst the frenzy of goals, in the 73rd minute, Reece James knocked the ball past Potts and slotted an inch-perfect pass through West Ham’s defence to find Estêvão, leaving Malick Diouf face-down on the eighteen yard box. Estêvão, admittedly, overworked the chance in a similar fashion to his decisive miss at home against Palace. The incision, though, with which James picked up the ball in the defensive third and carved Palace open to find our bright-eyed young Brazilian winger brought a tear to my eye upon rewatch. It’s the sort of pass we’ve come to expect from Cole Palmer, reminiscent of that exquisite through-ball for Pedro Neto against Newcastle last season. I love this moment simply for what it foreshadows this season. Those few remaining Reece James doubters are due a rude awakening.

As always, some fans seem to be running wild with this result. Don’t get me wrong: it was a brilliant game, and Chelsea dominated every meaningful statistic; it was also, for my money, one of the easiest away fixtures we’ll have this season. Graham Potter has consistently proven he’s not equipped to manage at this level, and very little can be said of an unimproved West Ham squad which finished 14th last season. When Lucas Paquetá scored in the 6th minute, I felt the frustration of the players on the pitch, but I also knew they’d channel that frustration into a vicious response against which West Ham would inevitably capitulate. By the time Füllkrug’s 16th minute strike had been disallowed, it was clear Chelsea had shown up to fight for their first win of the season.

It ended up being a pretty standard affair. I don’t mean to understate it; I genuinely think West Ham are that shit. The team that Potter, or whoever hired him, has put together would do well to finish above Burnley this season. Between now and October 25th, I see them picking up four points at best. This is a classic case: Potter will be gone by November (if not much, much sooner), and the return fixture in January—under some interim manager, most likely Frank Lampard—will be a much tighter affair. To be perfectly honest, Graham Potter is one more bad loss away from the sort of résumé which even the English FA would scoff at. Potter’s future might rest in the hands of Wolverhampton, as God knows it’s not in his own.

As I’ve said, Chelsea did dominate in every meaningful dimension; yet this was the increasingly rare sort of match where the scoreline most accurately portrays both teams’ performances. After the 16th minute, even with the interruption of Niclas Füllkrug’s disallowed goal, Chelsea settled into a mean flow. Our newest corner routine, combined with some existential stinkers from Mads Hermansen, saw Chelsea lay siege to West Ham’s net, scoring three from only five corners. This is the same routine we deployed against Palace, as well as during parts of the Club Word Cup and preseason. Today, though, Chelsea bullied West Ham’s fledgling defense on every attacking set piece. Again, this is to be expected, especially after West Ham’s recent defensive reconstruction. While both the scoreline and our performance impressed, the true test of Chelsea’s edge won’t come until later in the season. We certainly needed to bounce back after our underwhelming start against Palace, but being early to the great West Ham flogging of 2026 is no cause for celebration. 

In a romantic way, though, I’ve chosen to see this as Potter’s grand farewell to life in London. He gave us all he could, and after a day like today, what else can you really ask for?

    date: "July 13, 2025",

Enzo Maresca has had a brilliant first season. He was rightfully questioned on appointment, looking like another BlueCo managerial gamble. In fairness, he kind of was. His appointment reflected the new ownership’s departure from the era of high-pedigree managers at Chelsea. Like Potter or Lampard before him, Maresca came in as a relative unknown at the highest level of management, facing questions about his leadership or tactical adaptability. After his first six months, some Chelsea fans were right to question his mentality, his shifting-of-the-goalposts when asked about the club’s immediate expectations, his insistence in December that we had no chance of winning the title from second place. But Maresca has risen to the challenge of Chelsea manager, sticking by his players, his tactics, his decisions, and to his credit, he’s made some bold decisions which have paid off; decisions like starting Reece James in midfield in a final, playing new arrival Joao Pedro over starter Nicholas Jackson in a semifinal, and pushing Cole Palmer to the left-wing to link Pedro Neto and Reece James on the right. His decision to stick by Robert Sanchez seems to be paying off, but starting Philip Jorgensen also won us the Conference League final. Maresca has shown, in this first season, that he’s capable of managing, coaching, and winning at the highest level. Today, he showed he’s able to beat the fiercest opposition with basically their own tactics. For the first time under this ownership, I see a proper Chelsea coach on the sidelines. 

Nicholas Jackson isn’t long for this world. Thank god we signed Pedro and Delap. If Nicholas Jackson had even touched the pitch today, we’d end up losing 4-3 with Caicedo out for ten months. However you slice it—by value, transfer fee, raw skill, or pedigree—Nicholas Jackson is rightfully our third choice striker. I actually think he’ll thrive in that squad role, with less pressure to lead the line or decide our season (which thankfully he didn’t). This could be a very successful season for Jackson off the bench, but I certainly don’t want to see him starting most league games. 

Does Madueke get a medal? I’m pretty sure he’s eligible for one, but it would be so funny if they don’t register him. I actually hope he gets one, just so he can have something to show off in the dressing room. If anything, he’s the most successful attacking player at his new club—surely that should help bump him in the starting order.

Malo Gusto kinda deserves to stay now. I said it. He’s performed fairly well in a Chelsea shirt and still has a decently high ceiling. He’s also 22 so I don’t see us selling him for a while. That being said, we’ll probably sell him tomorrow. 

Cole Palmer is world class. That can’t be doubted. He can do it at every level, AND he shows up in every final, which is more than can be said for most players. What a player man.

Reece James' side eye to Donald Trump might be the highlight of the tournament. I'm surprised they didn't let him lift the trophy. Also Gianni Infantino was allegedly in those Epstein papers.

Chelsea outplayed PSG in a manner no one else has this season. By the 70th minute, the Parisians looked tired and frustrated, exemplified in Joao Neves’s dirty hair pull on Cucurella. We’ve seen Cucu’s luscious locks result in a red card earlier in the season. I seem to remember it happening during the Euros too, though I can’t be bothered to look that up. By full-time, PSG were rattled the likes of which we haven’t seen this season. The normally cordial and beloved Luis Enrique was reduced to grabbing 23-year old Joao Pedro’s throat. PSG seemed to come into the match with this mentality, though, kicking off after the first goal (the reason for which wasn’t broadcast). I’m sure Chelsea players were taunting them, and I’m sure Joao Pedro said something foul to Luis Enrique, but the lack of decorum from a team that’s been so well-loved this season was frankly shocking. I guess until now we haven’t seen how they take losing. Clearly, they take it very poorly. 

Joao Pedro might be the difference-maker. Within the span of 12 days he’s been signed for £55 million, yanked from his summer holiday, thrown into the knockout round of a major competition, and boosted us to victory over the European champions while securing his name on the team sheet. Of course, we have very little to go off, but if this isn’t a new-club bounce and Pedro continues this form for us, we might have the next elite Chelsea striker on our hands.

This season will be remembered as the season where Chelsea stopped PSG. This treble-winning side can never be mentioned without also mentioning the team that finally beat them. 

I’ll say it again. Enzo Maresca is a tactical mastermind.

Two days ago I said PSG are due a shitter. What I didn’t account for, and what I should’ve seen coming, is that Cole Palmer has been long overdue a world class performance. Cashing in on six months of so-called “poor form,” Palmer stepped up to once again carry Chelsea to a trophy, slotting in two near-identical goals and assisting Chelsea’s third in the span of 21 minutes. In the latter stages of this competition, Palmer has rekindled the jaw-dropping form displayed in his debut Chelsea season. With Pedro Neto—our biggest attacking threat this tournament—pushed to the left, Palmer was left with enough space to carve PSG’s defense open. His first goal was classic Palmer, picking the ball up on the edge of the box, switching it to his left foot, and placing it in Donarumma’s bottom-left corner. The second goal would’ve been infuriating from a PSG perspective, as Palmer ran the length of their half, cut inside, sat Lucas Beraldo down, and eased it into the same corner. The assist was equally skillful, as he picked out a diagonal Joao Pedro run which left Vitinha looking like 2024 Casemiro. Palmer’s performance today elicits sympathy for all the doubters who insisted he isn’t a world-class player. That’s 34 goal contributions for Cole Palmer this season, 5 of which came in the two cup finals we played this season—both of which we won.

Today was about more than just Cole Palmer, though, essential as he is to Chelsea’s success. Chelsea played a mature, controlled game. From the start it was clear that every player understood the weight of the game, and that each one of them was ready to meet the occasion. What we saw today wasn’t just a vintage Chelsea performance, but a foreshadowing of what’s to come. The great Chelsea teams of old might have sat in, held on, and grabbed a goal at the death; this team truly outmatched PSG in determination, confidence, and, above all, clinicality. That last term has haunted Chelsea for the past few years, with the likes of Nicholas Jackson, Raheem Sterling, and Noni Madueke leading the line. The team that played today was downright ruthless in front of goal, scoring three from the five shots on target we had, and, for whatever the stat is worth, confidently winning the xG battle 2.08 to 0.53. To finally leave a mark on Paris’ silky clean sheets is one thing, but to do so while shutting out their star-studded attack of Ballon d’Or contenders is another thing entirely. The defensive solidity shown especially by the likes of Trevoh Chalobah and Marc Cucurella harkens back to the title-winning Chelsea sides of old. Cucurella’s defensive IQ was on full display in the 16th minute as he read Desire Doue’s cut-back and prevented what was Paris’s best chance of the first half. This too at 0-0, a moment which, if it weren’t for the Euro-winning left-back, might’ve rewritten the outcome of this tournament. 

Malo Gusto also deserves recognition for covering the entire right wing, allowing Cole Palmer to drift inside and change the match.  This was one of Gusto’s best all-round performances in a Chelsea shirt, and in fairness, the back-up right back has had a good tournament so far. Gusto might even look to make the position his own as yet again Enzo Maresca chose to start Reece James in midfield. This choice worried me going into the game. I’m not too proud to admit that when I saw Reece James in the midfield line-up, I began nervously recalling the match against Flamengo, where James (and, to be fair, the whole team) looked too sluggish to perform well. I’m happy to write that performance off, though, in light of the solidity and confidence he displayed as a holding midfielder today. He impacted the game on all fronts, defending, attacking, and transitioning the ball well from the center of the park. Reece played as an anchor in defense, linking Colwill and Chalobah to the more advanced midfield of Caicedo and Fernandez. All three—Reece James, Enzo Fernandez, and Moises Caicedo—went toe-to-toe with what has been lauded as the tightest midfield three in Europe. And what needs to be said about Caicedo and Fernandez that hasn’t been said this season? Chelsea have created a world-class double pivot, and we should all pray that the club can retain both players’ services into the immediate future. 

I should also begrudgingly mention Robert Sanchez, who went on to claim the tournament’s Golden Glove. I said in my preview that Sanchez was the man most likely to lose us this final. The other side of that statement—as Sanchez showed—was that Chelsea’s hopes of winning depended on him pulling out a solid performance. That he did. The 27 year-old keeper might genuinely be coming into his own this tournament, keeping three clean sheets in six matches and putting up his best performance in living memory in today’s final. While our defensive solidity kept PSG from getting many troubling shots off, Robert Sanchez has to be credited for stepping up when called upon. There was a period between the start of the second half and roughly the 65th minute where PSG were at their most goal-hungry, dominating possession and creating a few decent chances. Sanchez kept his composure under pressure, looked comfortable collecting loose balls and crosses, and made all the right decisions you’d expect from a top class first-team keeper. While there has been buzz around Chelsea’s number one spot, it wouldn’t surprise me if the club uses this sort of performance as justification for keeping him. This seems like a turning point for Sanchez’s reputation; if he can keep this sort of form going into the upcoming season, I think Chelsea fans will come around and even embrace him.

This win is massive for this Chelsea team and ownership. While I’ve been less than convinced by the model and fairly cynical about Boehly and Eghbali’s intentions, I won’t be complaining if it all turns out to work. Of course, this is no great achievement for Chelsea as a club. We were the biggest club in London long before this final, and today only widens that gap. But for these young players, led by a relatively inexperienced manager, this needs to be the fire that turns us from good into great, from challengers into champions. 

Chelsea are back where we belong, among the world’s best. Give us London, give us England, give us Europe, give us the world.

They’ve done it again, those tricky reds. Another bright young Chelsea future snuffed out at Arsenal. First Kai Havertz—the most clinical striker in the world*—then Kepa Arrizabalaga—the most expensive keeper of all time (for good reason)—and now Tottenham legend Nonzino Man-dueke. What can I say about Noni that hasn’t been said in the past few days, other than this: you’ve got a world beater, Arsenal. Treat him well—we all know you will.

In all seriousness, Arsenal’s £52 million purchase of Noni Madueke confounds me just as much as everyone else. It’s one of those rare signings where seemingly every fan, neutral or not, has reacted the same way. On the Chelsea side, fans aren’t particularly lamenting the loss of Madueke; by that same token, Arsenal fans don’t appear all that excited by his arrival. Everyone—myself included—seems to agree that it’s not the signing Arsenal needs. Of course, they can’t be faulted for looking to strengthen their squad, and historically they seem reliant on Chelsea to do so. If this were a title-winning side adding to the ranks, I could better understand the signing. Madueke is a decent, promising young player, capable of changing games by cutting inside and planting one in the back corner of the net. But this isn’t a City or Liverpool deepening their bench; it’s an aspirational Arsenal splashing significant cash on an understudy. I imagine the most infuriating aspect from a Gooner perspective is that Arsenal are still reluctant to spend a comparable amount of money on a striker. While stalling the Gyokeres deal over a few million quid which the club insist they don’t have, they lock down Chelsea’s second/third-choice right winger. 

None of this is to say it can’t turn out to be a good signing. As I’ve said, Madueke is a good player. But as plenty have already pointed out, he’s not the game changer Arsenal need to close the gap on first. He’s nowhere near Bukayo Saka in consistency, and he’d be competing with Nwaneri for minutes off the bench. His most obvious route to a starting role is if Saka goes out with another months-long injury. This isn’t a bad opportunity for Madueke, and I have no doubt he’d rise to the occasion, but he’d have the same opportunity at Chelsea were Neto or Palmer out injured—alongside the minutes he was already getting. Maybe, though, Mikel Arteta sees Madueke as a left-footed left winger, banging in crosses and weak-foot passes to the edge of the box. You’d find this even less plausible if you watched the latter half of last season, where Madueke made several underwhelming appearances on the left. He’s never been the most involved player, hesitant to track back and frequently taking on the hardest, most selfish shot possible. Playing on the left for Chelsea, Madueke became practically invisible, leaving little to no visual impact and accruing no goal contributions in his seven starts there last season. Arsenal have spent first-team money on a player who, simply put, would struggle to start over Leandro Trossard or a fit Gabriel Martinelli. Maybe this is one for the future, and maybe Madueke will cultivate genuine consistency over his first season at Arsenal. With an obscure path to consistent starting minutes, though, I worry Madueke will find himself in the same liminal predicament he was in at Chelsea.

PSG are due a shitter. 

The Parisians have a combined scoreline of 16-1 across the six games they’ve played in this year’s Club World Cup. That one goal conceded? During the second matchday, when Botafogo, in what might go down as a turning point in world football, overturned the European Champions 1-0. And to the credit of Botafogo, Luis Enrique fielded a fierce starting lineup and eventually used all five substitutions available to him. While the loss was by no means resounding, it did show that PSG are capable of being picked apart and denied, even by firm underdogs.

While Chelsea are not such firm underdogs, it’s hard to deny that PSG are the best team in the world at the moment—my only wish is that we had seen them play Barcelona in the Champions League final. They’ve been a joy to watch in the latter half of this season; they’re a dynamic, fluid, yet clinical and ruthless force who have trampled practically every European giant (and non-giant) stood in their way. In possession, Enrique’s made great use of two fast, intelligent, attacking wing-backs—both unsung heroes of PSG’s success—overlapping an interchangeable front three of surgical, incisive wingers and inside forwards. It’s hard to pick one star, and that’s been the root of their success this season. In a classic case of what I call “The Ronaldo Effect,” removing the most talked about man in football from the team has allowed them to actually focus on their game, and they don’t look like letting up anytime soon.

But Chelsea are Chelsea, and you best believe that Luis Enrique knows that. We’ve been underdogs in most international finals, and ran out winners in many of them. For the first time since Tuchel, the Chelsea of the past few months and weeks has looked a cohesive, confident, capable team. Out of nowhere, and with basically no changes, Maresca turned what was a shockingly uninspiring defensive line into a solid, reliable unit: Levi Colwill has matured leaps and bounds in this last season, showing not just better decision making but a confidence and leadership which harkens back to Chelsea centre backs of old; Tosin Adarabioyo, the elder statesman (at 27), has been a solid second choice for the best part of last season; in the Fluminense semifinal, Trevoh Chalobah looked his old, composed self, keeping the ball as far away from Robert Sanchez as possible. And what needs to be said about Marc Cucurella, Chelsea’s knight in shining armor? If not the best left-back in the world, Cucu is second only to his Iberian counterpart at PSG, Nuno Mendes. And last but not least, a purportedly fit Reece James, who’s looking to start on Sunday, has the unique ability to decide big matches—we can only hope the Captain stars in the final. 

Offensively, Chelsea continue to look promising. Cole Palmer’s on form, Pedro Neto’s up for player of the tournament, and the new boys are getting it done. Even Christopher Nkunku was balling out against Fluminense. Nicholas Jackson—who I’ll touch on in another post—still seems to be our weakest attacking link. With Joao Pedro and Liam Delap available, I should hope Maresca doesn’t choose the final as Jackson’s last-chance saloon, although I’m increasingly worried he will. Maresca has shown a ruthlessness, though, in his recent treatment of Jackson, which leaves me hoping that Delap or Pedro will get the nod. Behind the attack, Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez have been mint. Fernandez plays the more attacking role, scoring once and assisting thrice this tournament, while Caicedo has carved out his status as one of the world’s best holding midfielders. Watching him in the semi, I had to hold back the tears remembering N’golo Kante’s contribution to our Champions League winning run. For Chelsea fans of a certain age, who grew up wishing they could have seen Super Frank and N’Golinho in the double pivot, Caicedo and Fernandez arouse some strange sense of dream-nostalgia. Off the bench, Andrey Santos looks the real deal, and little needs to be said about Romeo Lavia’s ability (when fit!). 

Our biggest weakness, and the man most likely to lose us this final, is Robert Sanchez. While the 27 year old goalkeeper has looked more assured between the sticks this tournament, little needs to be said about his poor performance in one-on-ones and generally cringeworthy decision making. In a Chelsea career spanning two seasons and repeated calls for his dismissal, Robert Sanchez has succeeded only in widening the gap between Chelsea supporters and the club’s management. His status at Chelsea confounds me; either the coaching staff or the board see something in Sanchez that no one else does, and maybe his semi-reliable performance in this competition is enough to justify keeping him. For myself, and, I suspect, the majority of fans, Robert Sanchez induces sheer panic whenever he gets near the ball. Against the most shrewd, clinical team in the world, Sanchez has nowhere to hide. While I hope to god he rises to the occasion, a loss in this final might guarantee his exit. What do I know, though, except this: EghBoehly works in mysterious ways. 

For his part, Enzo Maresca has also shown a degree of flexibility throughout this competition, rotating positions and adapting his system for who he has available. Above all, Maresca has to be credited for getting us to this final. It might be the optimist in me choosing to believe Maresca threw the match against Flamengo, but whether that’s true or not, he’s steered us through the knock-outs comfortably. And now, his team has reached its biggest test thus far. Financially, the $40 million difference between winning and losing is notable, but shouldn’t change anything major for Chelsea’s summer strategy and future planning. This final means far more for the players, who kicked on this season and, in the past few months, began to look like a well-tuned, cohesive unit. Win or lose—and I hope its win—this infamously young team has gained a lot from this tournament, and a good showing in this final will undoubtedly boost our confidence going into next season. The first big final is a milestone for every great Chelsea team (just as the Conference League final was a milestone for our B-team). These are the games we’re meant to play in, and there’s no doubt in my mind this is the first of many for this new Chelsea side. PSG are due a shitter. Come on Chels.

    content: `Okay, okay, I get it, believe me: there are too many idiots sharing opinions about football. The internet was a beautiful concept. Sadly, for all the good it’s done, the World Wide Web has also enabled every dickhead who did five keepy-uppies in year nine to spew sacreligious bile from the atomized comfort of their two bedroom flat. Enter your dear author, born and raised in the dark isolation of YouTube videos and social media. A sort of Bane figure, if you will. I digress. 
    
There are too many idiots sharing opinions about football. Each day, I come to this conclusion in some way or another: as I scroll minute-long clips of professional actors hocking milktoast opinions on players they never watched, or when I see said former players grifting for Keir Starmer’s austere Labor or the World Economic Forum. In fairness, I don’t expect much from mainstream media, and less so when it comes to football. The press is always bought, especially in Europe; you need only have observed the generational media support for Gareth Southgate’s knighthood bid to realize this. 

The worst offenders in the football media shitscape are the once-journos-turned-PR-machines, fastidiously reporting on Lamine Yamal’s wet dreams while private consortiums buy up every mid-level team in Europe and FIFA colludes with world leaders. The outlook for regular fans like me is bleak, and each day I find myself seeking a place to gather my thoughts and put them out into the world, however insignificant they might be. I love this sport, and I love talking about it, so I’ve created this site/blog/fan forum as a place for me to talk about football. You might hate what I have to say. You might not. In all likelihood, you probably won’t even read it. I don’t really care. If you’re interested, stick around.

While I won’t be focusing solely on Chelsea, I’ve themed this site around them because, well, they are my club, and for whatever reason I enjoy discussing them. Most of the things I post here will have to do with Chelsea, although I’ll throw in some general observations and think (stink) pieces. I’ll be updating and restructuring this website as I see fit; it’s a living passion project.
