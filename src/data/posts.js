There are many places you could begin after a game like that. I’ll start with one of my favorite moments: amidst the frenzy of goals, in the 73rd minute, Reece James knocked the ball past Potts and slotted an inch-perfect pass through West Ham’s defence to find Estêvão, leaving Malick Diouf face-down on the eighteen yard box. Estêvão, admittedly, overworked the chance in a similar fashion to his decisive miss at home against Palace. The incision, though, with which James picked up the ball in the defensive third and carved Palace open to find our bright-eyed young Brazilian winger brought a tear to my eye upon rewatch. It’s the sort of pass we’ve come to expect from Cole Palmer, reminiscent of that exquisite through-ball for Pedro Neto against Newcastle last season. I love this moment simply for what it foreshadows this season. Those few remaining Reece James doubters are due a rude awakening.

As always, some fans seem to be running wild with this result. Don’t get me wrong: it was a brilliant game, and Chelsea dominated every meaningful statistic; it was also, for my money, one of the easiest away fixtures we’ll have this season. Graham Potter has consistently proven he’s not equipped to manage at this level, and very little can be said of an unimproved West Ham squad which finished 14th last season. When Lucas Paquetá scored in the 6th minute, I felt the frustration of the players on the pitch, but I also knew they’d channel that frustration into a vicious response against which West Ham would inevitably capitulate. By the time Füllkrug’s 16th minute strike had been disallowed, it was clear Chelsea had shown up to fight for their first win of the season.

It ended up being a pretty standard affair. I don’t mean to understate it; I genuinely think West Ham are that shit. The team that Potter, or whoever hired him, has put together would do well to finish above Burnley this season. Between now and October 25th, I see them picking up four points at best. This is a classic case: Potter will be gone by November (if not much, much sooner), and the return fixture in January—under some interim manager, most likely Frank Lampard—will be a much tighter affair. To be perfectly honest, Graham Potter is one more bad loss away from the sort of résumé which even the English FA would scoff at. Potter’s future might rest in the hands of Wolverhampton, as God knows it’s not in his own.

As I’ve said, Chelsea did dominate in every meaningful dimension; yet this was the increasingly rare sort of match where the scoreline most accurately portrays both teams’ performances. After the 16th minute, even with the interruption of Niclas Füllkrug’s disallowed goal, Chelsea settled into a mean flow. Our newest corner routine, combined with some existential stinkers from Mads Hermansen, saw Chelsea lay siege to West Ham’s net, scoring three from only five corners. This is the same routine we deployed against Palace, as well as during parts of the Club Word Cup and preseason. Today, though, Chelsea bullied West Ham’s fledgling defense on every attacking set piece. Again, this is to be expected, especially after West Ham’s recent defensive reconstruction. While both the scoreline and our performance impressed, the true test of Chelsea’s edge won’t come until later in the season. We certainly needed to bounce back after our underwhelming start against Palace, but being early to the great West Ham flogging of 2026 is no cause for celebration. 

In a romantic way, though, I’ve chosen to see this as Potter’s grand farewell to life in London. He gave us all he could, and after a day like today, what else can you really ask for?

    title: "SOME MORE THOUGHTS ON THE FINAL",
    date: "July 13, 2025",

Enzo Maresca has had a brilliant first season. He was rightfully questioned on appointment, looking like another BlueCo managerial gamble. In fairness, he kind of was. His appointment reflected the new ownership’s departure from the era of high-pedigree managers at Chelsea. Like Potter or Lampard before him, Maresca came in as a relative unknown at the highest level of management, facing questions about his leadership or tactical adaptability. After his first six months, some Chelsea fans were right to question his mentality, his shifting-of-the-goalposts when asked about the club’s immediate expectations, his insistence in December that we had no chance of winning the title from second place. But Maresca has risen to the challenge of Chelsea manager, sticking by his players, his tactics, his decisions, and to his credit, he’s made some bold decisions which have paid off; decisions like starting Reece James in midfield in a final, playing new arrival Joao Pedro over starter Nicholas Jackson in a semifinal, and pushing Cole Palmer to the left-wing to link Pedro Neto and Reece James on the right. His decision to stick by Robert Sanchez seems to be paying off, but starting Philip Jorgensen also won us the Conference League final. Maresca has shown, in this first season, that he’s capable of managing, coaching, and winning at the highest level. Today, he showed he’s able to beat the fiercest opposition with basically their own tactics. For the first time under this ownership, I see a proper Chelsea coach on the sidelines. 

Nicholas Jackson isn’t long for this world. Thank god we signed Pedro and Delap. If Nicholas Jackson had even touched the pitch today, we’d end up losing 4-3 with Caicedo out for ten months. However you slice it—by value, transfer fee, raw skill, or pedigree—Nicholas Jackson is rightfully our third choice striker. I actually think he’ll thrive in that squad role, with less pressure to lead the line or decide our season (which thankfully he didn’t). This could be a very successful season for Jackson off the bench, but I certainly don’t want to see him starting most league games. 

Does Madueke get a medal? I’m pretty sure he’s eligible for one, but it would be so funny if they don’t register him. I actually hope he gets one, just so he can have something to show off in the dressing room. If anything, he’s the most successful attacking player at his new club—surely that should help bump him in the starting order.

Malo Gusto kinda deserves to stay now. I said it. He’s performed fairly well in a Chelsea shirt and still has a decently high ceiling. He’s also 22 so I don’t see us selling him for a while. That being said, we’ll probably sell him tomorrow. 

Cole Palmer is world class. That can’t be doubted. He can do it at every level, AND he shows up in every final, which is more than can be said for most players. What a player man.

Reece James' side eye to Donald Trump might be the highlight of the tournament. I'm surprised they didn't let him lift the trophy. Also Gianni Infantino was allegedly in those Epstein papers.

Chelsea outplayed PSG in a manner no one else has this season. By the 70th minute, the Parisians looked tired and frustrated, exemplified in Joao Neves’s dirty hair pull on Cucurella. We’ve seen Cucu’s luscious locks result in a red card earlier in the season. I seem to remember it happening during the Euros too, though I can’t be bothered to look that up. By full-time, PSG were rattled the likes of which we haven’t seen this season. The normally cordial and beloved Luis Enrique was reduced to grabbing 23-year old Joao Pedro’s throat. PSG seemed to come into the match with this mentality, though, kicking off after the first goal (the reason for which wasn’t broadcast). I’m sure Chelsea players were taunting them, and I’m sure Joao Pedro said something foul to Luis Enrique, but the lack of decorum from a team that’s been so well-loved this season was frankly shocking. I guess until now we haven’t seen how they take losing. Clearly, they take it very poorly. 

Joao Pedro might be the difference-maker. Within the span of 12 days he’s been signed for £55 million, yanked from his summer holiday, thrown into the knockout round of a major competition, and boosted us to victory over the European champions while securing his name on the team sheet. Of course, we have very little to go off, but if this isn’t a new-club bounce and Pedro continues this form for us, we might have the next elite Chelsea striker on our hands.

This season will be remembered as the season where Chelsea stopped PSG. This treble-winning side can never be mentioned without also mentioning the team that finally beat them. 

I’ll say it again. Enzo Maresca is a tactical mastermind.

Two days ago I said PSG are due a shitter. What I didn’t account for, and what I should’ve seen coming, is that Cole Palmer has been long overdue a world class performance. Cashing in on six months of so-called “poor form,” Palmer stepped up to once again carry Chelsea to a trophy, slotting in two near-identical goals and assisting Chelsea’s third in the span of 21 minutes. In the latter stages of this competition, Palmer has rekindled the jaw-dropping form displayed in his debut Chelsea season. With Pedro Neto—our biggest attacking threat this tournament—pushed to the left, Palmer was left with enough space to carve PSG’s defense open. His first goal was classic Palmer, picking the ball up on the edge of the box, switching it to his left foot, and placing it in Donarumma’s bottom-left corner. The second goal would’ve been infuriating from a PSG perspective, as Palmer ran the length of their half, cut inside, sat Lucas Beraldo down, and eased it into the same corner. The assist was equally skillful, as he picked out a diagonal Joao Pedro run which left Vitinha looking like 2024 Casemiro. Palmer’s performance today elicits sympathy for all the doubters who insisted he isn’t a world-class player. That’s 34 goal contributions for Cole Palmer this season, 5 of which came in the two cup finals we played this season—both of which we won.

Today was about more than just Cole Palmer, though, essential as he is to Chelsea’s success. Chelsea played a mature, controlled game. From the start it was clear that every player understood the weight of the game, and that each one of them was ready to meet the occasion. What we saw today wasn’t just a vintage Chelsea performance, but a foreshadowing of what’s to come. The great Chelsea teams of old might have sat in, held on, and grabbed a goal at the death; this team truly outmatched PSG in determination, confidence, and, above all, clinicality. That last term has haunted Chelsea for the past few years, with the likes of Nicholas Jackson, Raheem Sterling, and Noni Madueke leading the line. The team that played today was downright ruthless in front of goal, scoring three from the five shots on target we had, and, for whatever the stat is worth, confidently winning the xG battle 2.08 to 0.53. To finally leave a mark on Paris’ silky clean sheets is one thing, but to do so while shutting out their star-studded attack of Ballon d’Or contenders is another thing entirely. The defensive solidity shown especially by the likes of Trevoh Chalobah and Marc Cucurella harkens back to the title-winning Chelsea sides of old. Cucurella’s defensive IQ was on full display in the 16th minute as he read Desire Doue’s cut-back and prevented what was Paris’s best chance of the first half. This too at 0-0, a moment which, if it weren’t for the Euro-winning left-back, might’ve rewritten the outcome of this tournament. 

Malo Gusto also deserves recognition for covering the entire right wing, allowing Cole Palmer to drift inside and change the match.  This was one of Gusto’s best all-round performances in a Chelsea shirt, and in fairness, the back-up right back has had a good tournament so far. Gusto might even look to make the position his own as yet again Enzo Maresca chose to start Reece James in midfield. This choice worried me going into the game. I’m not too proud to admit that when I saw Reece James in the midfield line-up, I began nervously recalling the match against Flamengo, where James (and, to be fair, the whole team) looked too sluggish to perform well. I’m happy to write that performance off, though, in light of the solidity and confidence he displayed as a holding midfielder today. He impacted the game on all fronts, defending, attacking, and transitioning the ball well from the center of the park. Reece played as an anchor in defense, linking Colwill and Chalobah to the more advanced midfield of Caicedo and Fernandez. All three—Reece James, Enzo Fernandez, and Moises Caicedo—went toe-to-toe with what has been lauded as the tightest midfield three in Europe. And what needs to be said about Caicedo and Fernandez that hasn’t been said this season? Chelsea have created a world-class double pivot, and we should all pray that the club can retain both players’ services into the immediate future. 

I should also begrudgingly mention Robert Sanchez, who went on to claim the tournament’s Golden Glove. I said in my preview that Sanchez was the man most likely to lose us this final. The other side of that statement—as Sanchez showed—was that Chelsea’s hopes of winning depended on him pulling out a solid performance. That he did. The 27 year-old keeper might genuinely be coming into his own this tournament, keeping three clean sheets in six matches and putting up his best performance in living memory in today’s final. While our defensive solidity kept PSG from getting many troubling shots off, Robert Sanchez has to be credited for stepping up when called upon. There was a period between the start of the second half and roughly the 65th minute where PSG were at their most goal-hungry, dominating possession and creating a few decent chances. Sanchez kept his composure under pressure, looked comfortable collecting loose balls and crosses, and made all the right decisions you’d expect from a top class first-team keeper. While there has been buzz around Chelsea’s number one spot, it wouldn’t surprise me if the club uses this sort of performance as justification for keeping him. This seems like a turning point for Sanchez’s reputation; if he can keep this sort of form going into the upcoming season, I think Chelsea fans will come around and even embrace him.

This win is massive for this Chelsea team and ownership. While I’ve been less than convinced by the model and fairly cynical about Boehly and Eghbali’s intentions, I won’t be complaining if it all turns out to work. Of course, this is no great achievement for Chelsea as a club. We were the biggest club in London long before this final, and today only widens that gap. But for these young players, led by a relatively inexperienced manager, this needs to be the fire that turns us from good into great, from challengers into champions. 

Chelsea are back where we belong, among the world’s best. Give us London, give us England, give us Europe, give us the world.

They’ve done it again, those tricky reds. Another bright young Chelsea future snuffed out at Arsenal. First Kai Havertz—the most clinical striker in the world*—then Kepa Arrizabalaga—the most expensive keeper of all time (for good reason)—and now Tottenham legend Nonzino Man-dueke. What can I say about Noni that hasn’t been said in the past few days, other than this: you’ve got a world beater, Arsenal. Treat him well—we all know you will.

In all seriousness, Arsenal’s £52 million purchase of Noni Madueke confounds me just as much as everyone else. It’s one of those rare signings where seemingly every fan, neutral or not, has reacted the same way. On the Chelsea side, fans aren’t particularly lamenting the loss of Madueke; by that same token, Arsenal fans don’t appear all that excited by his arrival. Everyone—myself included—seems to agree that it’s not the signing Arsenal needs. Of course, they can’t be faulted for looking to strengthen their squad, and historically they seem reliant on Chelsea to do so. If this were a title-winning side adding to the ranks, I could better understand the signing. Madueke is a decent, promising young player, capable of changing games by cutting inside and planting one in the back corner of the net. But this isn’t a City or Liverpool deepening their bench; it’s an aspirational Arsenal splashing significant cash on an understudy. I imagine the most infuriating aspect from a Gooner perspective is that Arsenal are still reluctant to spend a comparable amount of money on a striker. While stalling the Gyokeres deal over a few million quid which the club insist they don’t have, they lock down Chelsea’s second/third-choice right winger. 

None of this is to say it can’t turn out to be a good signing. As I’ve said, Madueke is a good player. But as plenty have already pointed out, he’s not the game changer Arsenal need to close the gap on first. He’s nowhere near Bukayo Saka in consistency, and he’d be competing with Nwaneri for minutes off the bench. His most obvious route to a starting role is if Saka goes out with another months-long injury. This isn’t a bad opportunity for Madueke, and I have no doubt he’d rise to the occasion, but he’d have the same opportunity at Chelsea were Neto or Palmer out injured—alongside the minutes he was already getting. Maybe, though, Mikel Arteta sees Madueke as a left-footed left winger, banging in crosses and weak-foot passes to the edge of the box. You’d find this even less plausible if you watched the latter half of last season, where Madueke made several underwhelming appearances on the left. He’s never been the most involved player, hesitant to track back and frequently taking on the hardest, most selfish shot possible. Playing on the left for Chelsea, Madueke became practically invisible, leaving little to no visual impact and accruing no goal contributions in his seven starts there last season. Arsenal have spent first-team money on a player who, simply put, would struggle to start over Leandro Trossard or a fit Gabriel Martinelli. Maybe this is one for the future, and maybe Madueke will cultivate genuine consistency over his first season at Arsenal. With an obscure path to consistent starting minutes, though, I worry Madueke will find himself in the same liminal predicament he was in at Chelsea.

PSG are due a shitter. 

The Parisians have a combined scoreline of 16-1 across the six games they’ve played in this year’s Club World Cup. That one goal conceded? During the second matchday, when Botafogo, in what might go down as a turning point in world football, overturned the European Champions 1-0. And to the credit of Botafogo, Luis Enrique fielded a fierce starting lineup and eventually used all five substitutions available to him. While the loss was by no means resounding, it did show that PSG are capable of being picked apart and denied, even by firm underdogs.

While Chelsea are not such firm underdogs, it’s hard to deny that PSG are the best team in the world at the moment—my only wish is that we had seen them play Barcelona in the Champions League final. They’ve been a joy to watch in the latter half of this season; they’re a dynamic, fluid, yet clinical and ruthless force who have trampled practically every European giant (and non-giant) stood in their way. In possession, Enrique’s made great use of two fast, intelligent, attacking wing-backs—both unsung heroes of PSG’s success—overlapping an interchangeable front three of surgical, incisive wingers and inside forwards. It’s hard to pick one star, and that’s been the root of their success this season. In a classic case of what I call “The Ronaldo Effect,” removing the most talked about man in football from the team has allowed them to actually focus on their game, and they don’t look like letting up anytime soon.

But Chelsea are Chelsea, and you best believe that Luis Enrique knows that. We’ve been underdogs in most international finals, and ran out winners in many of them. For the first time since Tuchel, the Chelsea of the past few months and weeks has looked a cohesive, confident, capable team. Out of nowhere, and with basically no changes, Maresca turned what was a shockingly uninspiring defensive line into a solid, reliable unit: Levi Colwill has matured leaps and bounds in this last season, showing not just better decision making but a confidence and leadership which harkens back to Chelsea centre backs of old; Tosin Adarabioyo, the elder statesman (at 27), has been a solid second choice for the best part of last season; in the Fluminense semifinal, Trevoh Chalobah looked his old, composed self, keeping the ball as far away from Robert Sanchez as possible. And what needs to be said about Marc Cucurella, Chelsea’s knight in shining armor? If not the best left-back in the world, Cucu is second only to his Iberian counterpart at PSG, Nuno Mendes. And last but not least, a purportedly fit Reece James, who’s looking to start on Sunday, has the unique ability to decide big matches—we can only hope the Captain stars in the final. 

Offensively, Chelsea continue to look promising. Cole Palmer’s on form, Pedro Neto’s up for player of the tournament, and the new boys are getting it done. Even Christopher Nkunku was balling out against Fluminense. Nicholas Jackson—who I’ll touch on in another post—still seems to be our weakest attacking link. With Joao Pedro and Liam Delap available, I should hope Maresca doesn’t choose the final as Jackson’s last-chance saloon, although I’m increasingly worried he will. Maresca has shown a ruthlessness, though, in his recent treatment of Jackson, which leaves me hoping that Delap or Pedro will get the nod. Behind the attack, Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez have been mint. Fernandez plays the more attacking role, scoring once and assisting thrice this tournament, while Caicedo has carved out his status as one of the world’s best holding midfielders. Watching him in the semi, I had to hold back the tears remembering N’golo Kante’s contribution to our Champions League winning run. For Chelsea fans of a certain age, who grew up wishing they could have seen Super Frank and N’Golinho in the double pivot, Caicedo and Fernandez arouse some strange sense of dream-nostalgia. Off the bench, Andrey Santos looks the real deal, and little needs to be said about Romeo Lavia’s ability (when fit!). 

Our biggest weakness, and the man most likely to lose us this final, is Robert Sanchez. While the 27 year old goalkeeper has looked more assured between the sticks this tournament, little needs to be said about his poor performance in one-on-ones and generally cringeworthy decision making. In a Chelsea career spanning two seasons and repeated calls for his dismissal, Robert Sanchez has succeeded only in widening the gap between Chelsea supporters and the club’s management. His status at Chelsea confounds me; either the coaching staff or the board see something in Sanchez that no one else does, and maybe his semi-reliable performance in this competition is enough to justify keeping him. For myself, and, I suspect, the majority of fans, Robert Sanchez induces sheer panic whenever he gets near the ball. Against the most shrewd, clinical team in the world, Sanchez has nowhere to hide. While I hope to god he rises to the occasion, a loss in this final might guarantee his exit. What do I know, though, except this: EghBoehly works in mysterious ways. 

For his part, Enzo Maresca has also shown a degree of flexibility throughout this competition, rotating positions and adapting his system for who he has available. Above all, Maresca has to be credited for getting us to this final. It might be the optimist in me choosing to believe Maresca threw the match against Flamengo, but whether that’s true or not, he’s steered us through the knock-outs comfortably. And now, his team has reached its biggest test thus far. Financially, the $40 million difference between winning and losing is notable, but shouldn’t change anything major for Chelsea’s summer strategy and future planning. This final means far more for the players, who kicked on this season and, in the past few months, began to look like a well-tuned, cohesive unit. Win or lose—and I hope its win—this infamously young team has gained a lot from this tournament, and a good showing in this final will undoubtedly boost our confidence going into next season. The first big final is a milestone for every great Chelsea team (just as the Conference League final was a milestone for our B-team). These are the games we’re meant to play in, and there’s no doubt in my mind this is the first of many for this new Chelsea side. PSG are due a shitter. Come on Chels.

    content: `Okay, okay, I get it, believe me: there are too many idiots sharing opinions about football. The internet was a beautiful concept. Sadly, for all the good it’s done, the World Wide Web has also enabled every dickhead who did five keepy-uppies in year nine to spew sacreligious bile from the atomized comfort of their two bedroom flat. Enter your dear author, born and raised in the dark isolation of YouTube videos and social media. A sort of Bane figure, if you will. I digress. 
    
There are too many idiots sharing opinions about football. Each day, I come to this conclusion in some way or another: as I scroll minute-long clips of professional actors hocking milktoast opinions on players they never watched, or when I see said former players grifting for Keir Starmer’s austere Labor or the World Economic Forum. In fairness, I don’t expect much from mainstream media, and less so when it comes to football. The press is always bought, especially in Europe; you need only have observed the generational media support for Gareth Southgate’s knighthood bid to realize this. 

The worst offenders in the football media shitscape are the once-journos-turned-PR-machines, fastidiously reporting on Lamine Yamal’s wet dreams while private consortiums buy up every mid-level team in Europe and FIFA colludes with world leaders. The outlook for regular fans like me is bleak, and each day I find myself seeking a place to gather my thoughts and put them out into the world, however insignificant they might be. I love this sport, and I love talking about it, so I’ve created this site/blog/fan forum as a place for me to talk about football. You might hate what I have to say. You might not. In all likelihood, you probably won’t even read it. I don’t really care. If you’re interested, stick around.

While I won’t be focusing solely on Chelsea, I’ve themed this site around them because, well, they are my club, and for whatever reason I enjoy discussing them. Most of the things I post here will have to do with Chelsea, although I’ll throw in some general observations and think (stink) pieces. I’ll be updating and restructuring this website as I see fit; it’s a living passion project.
